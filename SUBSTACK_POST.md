# Code So Fresh It's Still Dripping: Meet Camille, Your New Favorite Security Guard

*In which we discuss why letting an AI review your code before another AI executes it might be the sanest thing you do today*

---

You know what I love about fresh code? Really fresh code? Code so new the pixels are still wet? It's like a newborn calf - wobbly, uncertain, probably going to fall over and cause a security breach that'll have your name trending on Hacker News for all the wrong reasons. 

Which brings me to Camille.

Now, before you ask - no, Camille isn't my third cousin twice removed, though the name does have a certain *je ne sais quoi*. Camille is what happens when you realize that having an AI write code without having another AI check that code is like letting your teenager borrow the car without asking if they know what a stop sign is. Remember that movie "Inception"? We need to go deeper. If AI is writing our code, who's reviewing the AI? That's right - another AI. It's AIs all the way down, but at least this one's wearing a security badge.

## The Problem with Modern Development (A Brief Dissertation)

Let me paint you a picture. It's 2 AM. You're using Claude Code - brilliant tool, by the way, absolute marvel of engineering. You ask it to implement user authentication. Claude, being the eager assistant it is, writes you a beautiful function. Gorgeous syntax. Elegant logic. Also stores passwords in plain text because you forgot to mention that whole "cryptographic hashing" thing.

You see the problem?

Remember "move fast and break things"? That was Facebook's motto, back when it was still called Facebook and not whatever dystopian metaverse thing it's calling itself these days. Well, here's the thing about moving fast with AI-generated code: you don't just break things, you break them at scale. With style. With panache. With SQL injection vulnerabilities that would make a 2009 WordPress plugin blush.

## Enter Camille (Stage Left, With Purpose)

Camille is what we in the business call a "pre-flight check." You know how pilots go through that whole rigmarole before takeoff? "Flaps, check. Landing gear, check. Not about to execute arbitrary SQL commands, check." That's Camille.

Here's how it works - and pay attention because this is where it gets interesting:

```bash
npm install -g claude-camille
```

One line. That's it. I've seen recipes for toast that were more complicated.

Once installed, Camille sets up shop as a bouncer at the velvet rope of your codebase. Every time Claude Code tries to write, edit, or update a file, Camille steps in with a few questions:

1. "Excuse me, is that a hardcoded password? Because that's about as secure as a screen door on a submarine."
2. "I see you're concatenating user input directly into SQL. Bold choice. Wrong, but bold."
3. "No error handling? What is this, amateur hour at the Apollo?"

## The Eight-Fold Path to Code Enlightenment

Now, Camille doesn't just wave a red flag and call it a day. No, no, no. It evaluates your code across eight dimensions - and before you ask, yes, I can name them all without looking at my notes:

1. **Security** (0-10): Because "hackable" isn't a feature
2. **Accuracy** (0-10): Will it compile? Will it run? Will it accidentally delete your production database?
3. **Algorithmic Efficiency** (0-10): O(nÂ²)? In this economy?
4. **Code Reuse** (0-10): Why write it twice when you can write it right?
5. **Operational Excellence** (0-10): Logs, monitoring, all that jazz
6. **Style Compliance** (0-10): Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, but it makes code reviews bearable
7. **Object-Oriented Design** (0-10): SOLID principles, not LIQUID confusion
8. **Architecture Patterns** (0-10): Because spaghetti belongs on a plate, not in your repository

Each dimension gets a score. Your code gets a report card. Your future self thanks you profusely.

## The Technical Wizardry (For Those Who Appreciate Such Things)

Here's where it gets properly clever. Camille uses OpenAI's embeddings - think of them as the DNA of your code - to understand not just what your code does, but what it *means*. It reads your CLAUDE.md file (you have one, right? Right?), understands your project's rules, and applies them with the dedication of a hall monitor who actually read the student handbook.

The MCP integration means it works seamlessly with Claude Code. No context switching. No copy-pasting into a separate tool. It's like having a brilliant, slightly obsessive colleague looking over your shoulder, except this colleague never needs coffee breaks and has memorized every CVE ever published.

## But Wait, There's More (As They Say in the Trade)

Camille doesn't just review code. Oh no. It's also a search virtuoso. Ask it to find "authentication logic" and it'll use semantic search - not just string matching, but actual understanding - to locate every place in your codebase where you're dealing with auth. It's like having a bloodhound that went to MIT.

## The Part Where I Ask You for Something

Now, here's the thing about open source projects - they're like barn raisings. Remember barn raisings? No? Well, the point is, they work better when people show up.

Camille is Apache 2.0 licensed, which in layman's terms means "take it, use it, make it better, just don't blame us if something goes sideways." We need contributors. We need people who look at this code and think, "You know what would make this better? If it also checked for..." 

Whatever comes after that "if" - that's what we need.

## The Philosophy Bit (Bear with Me)

You know what they say about opinions and... well, never mind. The point is, everyone's got one about AI. But here's what I think: In the digital world, nothing exists except ones and zeros; everything else is interpretation. And if we've learned anything from the last decade of tech mishaps - from Equifax to Colonial Pipeline - it's that interpretation without verification is how you end up explaining to Congress why half the Eastern Seaboard can't get gas.

And interpretation? That's where the trouble starts.

When we let AI write code without review, we're essentially saying, "I trust this pattern recognition system to understand not just syntax, but semantics, security, and the subtle art of not shooting myself in the foot." That's a lot of trust to place in what is, fundamentally, a very sophisticated autocomplete.

Camille is our hedge against that trust. It's the designated driver at the AI party. It's the friend who checks your text messages before you send them to your ex at 2 AM.

## In Conclusion (Finally, I Hear You Cry)

Look, I could go on. I could tell you about the elegant Python proxy that handles the MCP protocol. I could wax poetic about the hook system that intercepts code changes before they hit your repository. I could channel my inner TED Talk and tell you why this matters for the future of humanity.

But here's what you need to know:

1. Install Camille: `npm install -g claude-camille`
2. Run the setup wizard: `camille setup`
3. Sleep better at night knowing your AI assistant has adult supervision

Because at the end of the day, the question isn't whether AI can write code. We know it can. The question is whether we're smart enough to check its work.

And if we're not? Well, to err is human.

But to really mess things up? That takes unsupervised artificial intelligence.
